# 🚀 Deploy Now - Copy & Paste These Commands

## Ready to Deploy! Just run these 3 commands:

```bash
cd /Users/ken/Documents/GitHub/fashion_clip

# 1. Login (opens browser - do this first!)
railway login

# 2. Initialize project
railway init

# 3. Deploy!
railway up
```

## Or Use the Automated Script:

```

## What Each Command Does:

2. **`railway init`** - Creates Railway project (press Enter for default name)
3. **`railway up`** - Deploys your app (takes 10-15 min first time)

## After Deployment:

# Open in browser
railway open
```
